# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## Authentication

### "cookies file is required for Twitter/X"

Twitter/X requires browser cookies. Export `cookies.txt` from Chrome or Firefox using a
browser extension (see [COOKIES.md](COOKIES.md)).

```bash
provenance grab --cookies cookies.txt https://x.com/user
```

### Twitter/X hashtag search

```bash
provenance grab --cookies cookies.txt 'x:#golang'
provenance grab --cookies cookies.txt '#golang' --limit 500
```

- **Quote bare hashtags.** An unquoted `#` starts a shell comment. `x:#golang`
  (recommended) does not need quoting; `#golang` does.
- **Cookies are required** for the private web GraphQL search. The cookie file
  must contain `auth_token` and `ct0`; the extractor reports which is missing.
- **Best-effort only.** Search returns posts visible to the authenticated
  account and indexed by X. Deleted, protected, withheld, inaccessible, or
  otherwise omitted results cannot be downloaded. This is not an exhaustive
  historical archive of X.
- **Rate limits.** X rate-limits broad hashtags aggressively; the extractor
  honours `Retry-After` and returns partial results when rate-limited mid-scan.
  Use `--limit` for high-volume tags and lower `--concurrency` if needed.
- **"query id unavailable"** — the `SearchTimeline` query ID is discovered from
  X's web-client JS and has no hard-coded fallback. If discovery is blocked, set
  `TWITTER_QUERY_SEARCH_TIMELINE` to the current ID (copy it from a browser
  network trace).
- **"authentication failed (status 401/403)"** — re-export `cookies.txt` from a
  logged-in x.com session; sessions expire.
- The **private X web API can change at any time**; if search stops working, the
  extractor may need an update (new operation shape/query ID).

### "cookies file is required for Instagram"

Instagram requires an authenticated session cookie. Export `cookies.txt` from your browser
after logging in to instagram.com.

```bash
provenance grab --cookies cookies.txt https://www.instagram.com/user/
```

### Instagram returns no posts or empty results

Instagram requires cookies. Without cookies the API will return empty or restricted results.
Make sure your session cookie is fresh - if it expired, re-export from your browser.

## Missing tools

### "ffmpeg not found" / audio-only fails

Install ffmpeg or run `provenance install`:

```bash
provenance install
# or system package manager:
#   Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg
#   macOS: brew install ffmpeg
#   Windows: winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```

## Download failures

### "unsupported URL" / generic site doesn't work

provenance automatically falls back to headless Chrome for JS-heavy sites. If that also fails,
try with cookies:

```bash
provenance grab --cookies cookies.txt https://js-heavy-site.com/video
```

### Rate limited (429 errors)

Lower concurrency or use sessions to resume later:

```bash
provenance grab --concurrency 1 --session my-session URL
# ... wait, then ...
provenance resume my-session
```

### "context deadline exceeded" / timeout

Network issues. The download likely progressed - resume the session:

```bash
provenance resume my-session
```

### Partial download or interrupted by Ctrl+C

Sessions persist across interruptions. Resume from where you left off:

```bash
provenance resume my-session
# or retry only failed URLs:
provenance retry-failed my-session
```

## Docker / containerized environments

### Chrome fails with "No usable sandbox" or "SUID sandbox helper"

Headless Chrome requires either a working sandbox or the `--no-sandbox` flag. In Docker
containers without `--privileged` or seccomp profiles, run Chrome with:

```bash
provenance grab --no-sandbox https://js-heavy-site.com/video
```

Without this flag, Chrome will fail to start inside most containers and the browser
fallback extractor will be unavailable.

### yt-dlp / ffmpeg auto-install in ephemeral containers

In ephemeral containers, the auto-installed tools in `~/.cache/go-ytdlp` are lost on
restart. Pre-warm the cache during image build:

```bash
provenance install
```

Or bind-mount the cache directory persistently.

## Preview issues

### Dry run to see what will download

```bash
provenance grab --dry-run https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL...
provenance scan https://x.com/user
provenance scan --json https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit
```

### Scan multiple sources to JSON

```bash
provenance scan --json URL1 URL2 URL3 > scan-report.json
provenance scan --save report.json URL1 URL2 URL3
```

## Reddit

### Low rate limits or limited results without OAuth

Without OAuth, Reddit's public API has lower rate limits and may return fewer posts.
Register a Reddit app and set environment variables:

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your-id"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your-secret"
provenance grab https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit
```

## Sessions

### Session file locked or corrupted

Sessions use atomic writes with optimistic concurrency. If you experience issues:

```bash
provenance sessions list             # check all sessions
provenance sessions export <name>    # export before deleting
provenance sessions clean <name>     # remove a session cleanly
```

### Session not found

Session names are sanitized (spaces, slashes replaced). Use exact names from:

```bash
provenance sessions list
```
